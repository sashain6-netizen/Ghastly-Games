        <p>Special thanks to Nael for the support he gave me. He's a bum who doesn't know what a repo is. So text him at 669-321-6638 to annoy him.</p>
        <p>I built this as a fun project. If you're a teacher reading this, I'm sorry for everything. WHAT HAS MY LIFE BECOME!</p>
        <p>I took a ton of time working on this (almost 10 minutes) so please enjoy. If you don't, I will find you and I will make you. (Enjoy it, not anything sinister) :D</p>
        <p>Use this same form if one of the sites is not working. I'll try to fix it as soon as possible! (I like to lie on the couch and do nothing so don't expect anything)</p>
        <p>Finally, you can reach me at InstallAVirus.buzz and click "Download" on the first link to get my email.</p>
        <p>Bum of the Day: The bum of the day is currently Oscar Lopez!</p>
